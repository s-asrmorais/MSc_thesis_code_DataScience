# Application of Explainable AI in Machine Learning models to identify the main determinants of Bitcoin price

### Sofia Morais


First of all, this code is associated with a Master's thesis and aims to answer three fundamental questions. 

Firstly, this study provides three models with different degrees of complexity that use time series data.

Secondly, the lack of transparency of complex Machine Learning models required applying at least one fundamental XAI technique, namely, interpretability, so the impact of the features on the outcome variable could be measured.

Thirdly, this research will identify which explanatory variables are relevant to predict the Bitcoin price. 

The raw data used for pre-processing is a dataset related to the article of Rajabi et al., 2022. Afterwards, new built-in variables were added, and feature engineering was proceeded to enrich the original dataset.

Last of all, this project is organized into four files. One presents all the necessary pre-processing for modelling. Each of the remaining files explains all the modelling processes for GLSAR, LSTM and DNN.
